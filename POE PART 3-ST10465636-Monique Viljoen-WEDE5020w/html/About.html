This mission aligns with UN Sustainable Development Goal 2: Zero Hunger, and seeks to promote long-term food justice through grassroots action.</p>
                <p>Food insecurity affects nearly 20% of South African households, especially in urban informal settlements (StatsSA, 2024). In this context, Bread for All Foundation plays a vital role in supplementing basic nutrition through community-driven programs such as:</p>
