            <h3>Soup Kitchens</h3>
            <p>Our soup kitchens operate in multiple communities every week, offering warm, nutritious meals to those in need. We prioritise children, the elderly, and unemployed individuals who face daily food insecurity. Beyond just food, our kitchens are a place of dignity, compassion, and community.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section service-item" data-category="parcels">
            <h3>Food Parcel Programmes</h3>
            <p>For families who cannot attend our soup kitchens, we distribute food parcels containing essentials such as maize meal, rice, beans, cooking oil, and tinned goods. These parcels help sustain households for a week or more, providing immediate relief while we work on long-term hunger solutions.</p>

        <h3>Measuring Our Impact</h3>
        <p>Our monthly meal distribution goals are visualised using infographics on our website, so donors and supporters can see real progress at a glance. This transparency ensures that every supporter knows the difference their contribution makes.</p>
        <p>By following nonprofit best practices, we focus on donor retention and community-building to create long-term solutions to hunger, not just temporary fixes.</p>
