                <p>Our soup kitchens operate in multiple communities every week, offering warm, nutritious meals to those in need.

                <p>For families who cannot attend our soup kitchens, we distribute food parcels containing essentials such as maize meal, rice, beans, cooking oil, and tinned goods. These parcels help sustain households for a week or more, providing immediate relief while we work on long-term hunger solutions.</p>
