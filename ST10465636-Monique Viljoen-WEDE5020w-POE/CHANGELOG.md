  ## Summary
The CSS file provides a comprehensive styling framework for a website, emphasizing typography, layout, visual design, and responsiveness. It begins by importing the Montserrat and Open Sans fonts from Google Fonts to ensure consistent typography across the site (W3Schools, 2023). Default styles are established with a universal reset (*) for margins, padding, and box-sizing, while the body element sets a base font, background color, and spacing (Duckett, 2011). Typography is meticulously crafted with varying font sizes, line heights, and weights for headings and paragraphs, using Montserrat for headings and Open Sans for body text, creating a harmonious scale (Meyer, 2014). Layouts leverage Flexbox for navigation (nav) and content containers (.content), while visual styles are enhanced with properties like background-color, border, box-shadow, and pseudo-classes such as :hover, :focus, and :active to add interactivity (Rutter, 2019). Unique features include a watermark using the ::before pseudo-element, 3D block effects with hover transitions, and an animated car with keyframes, showcasing advanced CSS techniques (Cederholm, 2010). Responsive design is achieved through a media query at 768px, adjusting layouts, typography, and disabling certain 3D effects for smaller screens (Marcotte, 2011).
